Domain model is developed during [DDD-WRO](http://www.meetup.com/DDD-WRO/) meetings with domain expert from local injection moulding manufacturer of polymer parts for automotive industry and household devices.

# Business background

Currently client company controls their storage "manually" (with paper documents) and without managing the exact location of all stored components and products in any kind of software. 
Introduction of software should allow:
- keeping FIFO rule for delivering products and consuming components and materials,
- apply quality lock on parts produced in given batch or made of material from given batch. 

# Tech aspect

Code business first approach - starting from understanding of business and coding sufficient domain model is the primary thing.
Domain-Driven Design rules, Event Sourcing with CQRS and minimalism in all aspects goes next.
Latest and greatest open source frameworks and tools.

# Open source business code

Yep, it is open.
